# wtb-conversion-prep
A python program made to make preparing files for DDS-WTB Conversion easier. Made with modding Granblue Fantasy Relink in mind. It will grab all of the .dds found in the source folder, create folders in the destination folder with the appropriate name ("name.wtb_extracted"), and copies the .dds file into the new folder.

Requires the latest version of Python 3 found here: python.org

All you need to do to use this program is open a command terminal (for Windows, search for cmd in search bar).

Once open, type "python 'path to this main.py' 'path to destination folder' 'path to folder with your .dds files>'".
