# wtb-conversion-prep
A python program made to make preparing files for DDS-WTB Conversion easier. Made with modding Granblue Fantasy Relink in mind.

Requires the latest version of Python 3 found here: python.org

All you need to do to use this program is open a command terminal (for Windows, search for cmd in search bar).

Once open, type "python 'path to this main.py' 'path to destination folder' 'path to folder with your .dds files>'".
